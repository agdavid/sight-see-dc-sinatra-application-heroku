# SightSeeDC

Welcome to SightSeeDC! This application was inspired by a love for learning and visiting new sights. The application uses a database of information including sights in DC, augmented and improved by user contributions of sights and reviews.  Users can create a customized sightseeing list, contribute reviews, and view other users' lists and reviews. Enjoy SightSeeDC and see the city you want to see!
